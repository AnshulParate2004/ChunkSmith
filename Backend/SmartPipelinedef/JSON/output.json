The operation is defined as `LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x))`.\n*   To enable these residual connections, all sub-layers and embedding layers produce outputs of a fixed dimension, `dmodel = 512`.\n\n**Decoder:**\n*   Also composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers.\n*   Each layer has three sub-layers:\n    1.  A masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer.\n    2.  A multi-head attention sub-layer that attends to the output of the encoder stack.\n    3.  A position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n*   Similar to the encoder, residual connections and layer normalization are used for each sub-layer.\n*   The masking in the first sub-layer ensures that predictions for a position `i` can only depend on known outputs at positions less than `i`. This is crucial for auto-regressive generation.\n*   This causality is further supported by offsetting the output embeddings by one position, referred to as \"Outputs (shifted right)\".\n\n**Overall Flow:**\nInputs are converted to embeddings, positional encoding is added, and then they are processed by the encoder stack. The decoder takes the \"shifted right\" outputs, embeds them, adds positional encoding, and processes them through its stack, which also incorporates the encoder's output. The final output from the decoder stack is passed through a linear layer and a softmax layer to produce output probabilities.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\nFigure 1 provides a detailed diagram of the Transformer model architecture, visually separating it into two main columns: the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right.\n\n*   **Encoder (Left Column):**\n    *   The process begins with \"Inputs\" at the bottom, which are fed into an \"Input Embedding\" layer.\n    *   \"Positional Encoding\" is then added to the embeddings.\n    *   This combined tensor enters a large block labeled \"Nx\", indicating it contains N stacked layers.\n    *   Inside this block, there are two main sub-layers: \"Multi-Head Attention\" and \"Feed Forward\".\n    *   After each sub-layer, an \"Add & Norm\" step is performed, visually represented by an arrow that bypasses the sub-layer and merges with its output before normalization. This illustrates the residual connection (`x + Sublayer(x)`) and layer normalization.\n    *   The final output of the encoder stack is then passed over to the decoder.\n\n*   **Decoder (Right Column):**\n    *   The process begins with \"Outputs (shifted right)\" at the bottom, which are fed into an \"Output Embedding\" layer.\n    *   \"Positional Encoding\" is added, similar to the encoder side.\n    *   This enters a large block also labeled \"Nx\".\n    *   The decoder block contains three sub-layers:\n        1.  \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\": The first attention layer, which operates on the decoder's own inputs.\n        2.  \"Multi-Head Attention\": The second attention layer, which takes inputs from both the encoder's output (indicated by an arrow from the left column) and the output of the previous decoder sub-layer. This is the cross-attention mechanism.\n        3.  \"Feed Forward\": The final sub-layer.\n    *   Each of these three sub-layers is also followed by an \"Add & Norm\" step with residual connections.\n    *   The output of the decoder stack then passes through a final \"Linear\" layer and a \"Softmax\" layer to produce the \"Output Probabilities\".\n\nThe diagram clearly illustrates the parallel structure, the flow of information, the number of sub-layers in each component, and the application of key techniques like residual connections and layer normalization.\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nTransformer model architecture diagram and explanation. Details the encoder-decoder structure. The encoder consists of a stack of N=6 identical layers, each with two sub-layers: a Multi-Head Attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected Feed-Forward network. The decoder also has a stack of N=6 layers, but each layer contains three sub-layers: a Masked Multi-Head Attention, a cross-attention Multi-Head Attention over the encoder's output, and a Feed-Forward network. Both encoder and decoder employ residual connections (skip connections) and layer normalization (LayerNorm) after each sub-layer, following the formula LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). All sub-layers and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. The decoder uses masking to ensure causality, preventing positions from attending to subsequent positions. This is combined with feeding the decoder \"Outputs (shifted right)\". The model takes Inputs and produces Output Probabilities via a final Linear and Softmax layer. Other key concepts include Input Embedding, Output Embedding, and Positional Encoding.

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.",

The inputs to this function are queries (Q) and keys (K) of dimension dk, and values (V) of dimension dv. The calculation involves computing the dot product of the query with all keys, dividing by a scaling factor of the square root of dk (√dk), and then applying a softmax function to obtain weights for the values.\n\nThe complete function is expressed by the formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax( (QKT) / √dk )V.\n\nThe text compares this method to two other common attention functions:\n1.  **Additive Attention:** Computes compatibility using a feed-forward network. It is outperformed by dot-product attention in speed and space-efficiency because the latter can use highly optimized matrix multiplication.\n2.  **Dot-Product (Multiplicative) Attention:** This is identical to the described algorithm but lacks the scaling factor of 1/√dk.\n\nThe scaling factor is crucial. For large values of the dimension dk, the dot products can grow very large, pushing the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients (vanishing gradients problem). Scaling by 1/√dk counteracts this effect. While for small dk the performance is similar, additive attention can outperform unscaled dot-product attention for larger dk values.\n\nThe document also introduces \"Multi-Head Attention\" as a mechanism that runs several Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers in parallel, as illustrated in the accompanying figure.\n\n**IMAGE_INTERPRETATION:**\nThe document contains two diagrams, labeled as Figure 2.\n\n**Left Diagram: Scaled Dot-Product Attention**\nThis is a flowchart illustrating the computational steps of the Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism.\n*   **Inputs:** The diagram shows three inputs: Q (queries), K (keys), and V (values).\n*   **Flow:**\n    1.  Q and K are fed into a `MatMul` (Matrix Multiplication) block.\n    2.  The result is passed to a `Scale` block (corresponding to dividing by √dk).\n    3.  An optional `Mask` block follows, used for ignoring certain positions.\n    4.  The output is then passed through a `SoftMax` function to generate attention weights.\n    5.  These weights are then combined with the V (values) input in a final `MatMul` block.\n*   **Output:** The final arrow points upwards, representing the output of the attention layer.\n\n**Right Diagram: Multi-Head Attention**\nThis diagram shows the architecture of Multi-Head Attention, which uses Scaled Dot-Product Attention as a core component.\n*   **Inputs:** V, K, and Q are shown as inputs at the bottom.\n*   **Flow:**\n    1.  The inputs V, K, and Q are each passed through separate `Linear` layers.\n    2.  The outputs are then fed into multiple, parallel `Scaled Dot--Product Attention` layers (represented by stacked blocks). The 'h' indicates the number of parallel heads.\n    3.  The outputs from all parallel attention heads are combined in a `Concat` (Concatenation) block.\n    4.  This concatenated vector is then passed through a final `Linear` layer to produce the final output.\n*   **Concept:** This illustrates that Multi-Head Attention is composed of several Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanisms operating in parallel, allowing the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.\n\n**TABLE_INTERPRETATION:**\n***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***\n\n**SEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:**\nKeywords: Scaled Dot-Product Attention, Multi-Head Attention, attention mechanism, transformer model, queries, keys, values, Q, K, V, matrix, dk, dv. This document explains the formula and implementation of Scaled Dot-Product Attention: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKT / √dk)V. It details the process of computing dot products between queries and keys, scaling by the square root of the key dimension (dk), and applying a softmax function to get weights on the values. The scaling factor 1/√dk is introduced to prevent the softmax function from saturating and having extremely small gradients when dk is large. The text compares this method to additive attention and standard (unscaled) dot-product attention, highlighting that dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient due to optimized matrix multiplication. The content also includes diagrams (Figure 2) that visualize the computational flow of Scaled Dot-Product Attention and show how it serves as a building block for Multi-Head Attention, where multiple attention layers run in parallel.

Instead of using a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional queries, keys, and values, this approach uses multiple parallel attention functions, or 'heads'. Specifically, the queries, keys, and values are linearly projected 'h' times into lower dimensions: dk, dk, and dv, respectively. These projections are learned and different for each head.\n\nThe attention function is then performed in parallel on each of these 'h' projected sets of queries, keys, and values. Each head produces a dv-dimensional output. These 'h' output vectors are then concatenated together and passed through another linear projection to produce the final output values.\n\nThe primary benefit of this method is that it allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions simultaneously. In contrast, a single attention head would average these different pieces of information, which can inhibit this capability.\n\nThe text also provides a statistical justification for scaling dot products. It illustrates that if the components of the query (q) and key (k) vectors are assumed to be independent random variables with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, then their dot product (q · k) will have a mean of 0 and a variance equal to the dimension of the key, dk. This increasing variance with dimensionality is why scaling is necessary.\"\n\n**IMAGE_INTERPRETATION:**\n\"The text references Figure 2, which is not provided.
