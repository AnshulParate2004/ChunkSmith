The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.\n\nThe encoder's layers each have two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe decoder's layers have three sub-layers: a masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer, a multi-head attention sub-layer that attends over the encoder's output, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified with masking to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring predictions for position 'i' only depend on outputs at positions less than 'i'. This is combined with the output embeddings being offset by one position.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder employ residual connections around each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization. The output of each sub-layer is defined as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers and embedding layers in the model produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nThe model architecture starts with input and output embeddings, which are combined with positional encodings. The final output of the decoder stack is fed into a linear layer and a softmax layer to generate output probabilities.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 1 provides a detailed diagram of the Transformer model architecture, which is divided into two main components: the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right.\n\nThe encoder side shows the flow starting from \"Inputs\" which go into an \"Input Embedding\" layer, followed by the addition of \"Positional Encoding\". This combined embedding is then fed into a stack of N layers (indicated by \"Nx\"). Each layer in this stack consists of a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer followed by an \"Add & Norm\" step, and then a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, also followed by an \"Add & Norm\" step.\n\nThe decoder side starts with \"Outputs (shifted right)\" that go into an \"Output Embedding\" layer and also have \"Positional Encoding\" added. This is then fed into a similar stack of N layers. Each decoder layer has three sub-layers. The first is a \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\". The second is a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer that takes inputs from the encoder stack's output and the output of the previous decoder sub-layer, which is also followed by \"Add & Norm\". The third is a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, again followed by \"Add & Norm\".\n\nThe final output from the decoder stack is passed through a \"Linear\" layer and then a \"Softmax\" layer to produce the \"Output Probabilities\". The diagram clearly illustrates the residual connections around each sub-layer, which are then normalized (Add & Norm).\n\nTABLE ANALYSIS: ***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***",

What happens when dot-product attention is used for large values of dk without scaling? Why are the dot products scaled by 1/√dk? What is Multi-Head Attention?\n\nSUMMARY: This document describes \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\". The inputs for this function are queries (Q) and keys (K) of dimension dk, and values (V) of dimension dv. The process involves computing the dot products of the query with all keys, dividing each by √dk, and then applying a softmax function to get the weights on the values. The attention function is computed on a set of queries, keys, and values packed into matrices Q, K, and V. The formula to compute the matrix of outputs is: Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT / √dk)V. The two most common attention functions are additive attention and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Scaled Dot-Product Attention is identical to dot-product attention but includes a scaling factor of 1/√dk. Dot-product attention is significantly faster and more space-efficient because it can be implemented with highly optimized matrix multiplication. For larger values of dk, additive attention performs better than unscaled dot-product attention because large dot products can push the softmax function into regions with very small gradients. To counteract this, the dot products are scaled by 1/√dk. Figure 2 visually represents Scaled Dot-Product Attention and Multi-Head Attention, which is composed of several parallel attention layers.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 2 contains two diagrams. The left diagram illustrates \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\". It shows a flowchart where inputs Q (queries) and K (keys) undergo a matrix multiplication (MatMul). The result is then scaled, optionally masked, and passed through a SoftMax function. This output is then matrix multiplied with the input V (values) to produce the final output. The right diagram illustrates \"Multi-Head Attention\". It shows inputs V, K, and Q being fed into several parallel \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" layers. The outputs from these layers are concatenated and then passed through a final linear layer. The caption states: \"(left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention.

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√ . dk",

The queries, keys, and values are projected h times to dimensions dk, dk, and dv, respectively. The attention function is then performed in parallel on each of these projected versions. The resulting dv-dimensional output values are concatenated and projected again to produce the final values. This process is depicted in Figure 2. The main advantage of multi-head attention is that it allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions, which is inhibited by the averaging in a single attention head.
