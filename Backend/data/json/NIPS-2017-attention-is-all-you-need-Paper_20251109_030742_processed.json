The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.",

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs and gated recurrent networks, are established state-of-the-art approaches for tasks like language modeling and machine translation. However, recurrent models have limitations due to their sequential nature, which prevents parallelization during training and becomes a bottleneck for long sequences. Attention mechanisms have become integral to sequence modeling, allowing the modeling of dependencies regardless of distance. The Transformer leverages attention to draw global dependencies between input and output, enabling significantly more parallelization. The Transformer achieves state-of-the-art translation quality after being trained for only twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

        "original_text": "1 Introduction\n\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13].\n\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the ﬁrst Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efﬁcient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research.\n\n†Work performed while at Google Brain.\n\n‡Work performed while at Google Research.\n\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\n\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved signiﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional computation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc- tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.",

It contrasts the Transformer with other models like the Extended Neural GPU, ByteNet, and ConvS2S, which use convolutional neural networks for parallel computation. A key advantage of the Transformer is that the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary positions is constant, unlike ConvS2S (linear growth) and ByteNet (logarithmic growth). This helps the Transformer learn dependencies between distant positions more effectively. The text also mentions self-attention (intra-attention) and its successful applications in reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations. End-to-end memory networks, based on recurrent attention, are also mentioned as performing well on question answering and language modeling.

        "original_text": "2 Background\n\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.\n\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\n\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28].\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].",

The encoder consists of N=6 identical layers, each with a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. Residual connections and layer normalization are employed around each sub-layer. The decoder also has N=6 identical layers, with the addition of a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder output. The decoder's self-attention sub-layer is modified to prevent attending to subsequent positions using masking, and the output embeddings are offset by one position. All sub-layers and embedding layers produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.

It illustrates the encoder and decoder stacks. The encoder (left side) takes inputs, performs input embedding and positional encoding, and then passes through N identical layers.

Scaled Dot-Product Attention takes queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) as input, where queries and keys have dimension dk, and values have dimension dv. It computes the dot products of the query with all keys, divides each by the square root of dk (√dk), and applies a softmax function to obtain weights on the values. The formula for Scaled Dot-Product Attention is Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT/√dk)V. The document also compares Scaled Dot-Product Attention to additive attention, noting that while additive attention is similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient due to optimized matrix multiplication. However, additive attention can outperform dot-product attention without scaling for larger values of dk. The scaling factor 1/√dk is used to counteract the effect of large dot product magnitudes pushing the softmax function into regions with small gradients. Multi-Head Attention consists of several Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers running in parallel, followed by a concatenation and a linear transformation.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\nThe image on the left illustrates the architecture of Scaled Dot-Product Attention. The inputs are queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V). Q and K are fed into a MatMul (matrix multiplication) operation. The result is then scaled. An optional mask is applied. The result is then passed through a SoftMax function. Finally, the output of the SoftMax function and V are fed into another MatMul operation, producing the final output. The image on the right illustrates the architecture of Multi-Head Attention. It consists of multiple parallel Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers. Each attention layer receives Q, K, and V as inputs, each passed through a linear layer. The outputs of the attention layers are concatenated and then passed through a final linear layer.\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nScaled Dot-Product

Instead of a single attention function, multi-head attention projects the queries, keys, and values 'h' times with different learned linear projections to dimensions dk, dk, and dv, respectively. The attention function is then performed in parallel on these projected versions, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These outputs are concatenated and projected again to produce the final values. The formula for multi-head attention is given as MultiHead(Q,K,V ) = Concat(head1,...,headh)W O where headi = Attention(QW Q i ,KW K i ,V W V i ). The projection matrices are W Q i ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W K i ∈ Rdmodel×dk, W V i ∈ Rdmodel×dv and W O ∈ Rhdv×dmodel. In this work, h = 8 parallel attention layers (heads) are used, with dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. The computational cost is similar to single-head attention due to the reduced dimension of each head. The text also explains why the dot products get large, assuming the components of q and k are independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1, then their dot product has mean 0 and variance

The first is \"encoder-decoder attention,\" where queries originate from the previous decoder layer, while keys and values come from the encoder's output. This allows the decoder to attend to all positions in the input sequence, mimicking traditional encoder-decoder attention mechanisms. The second application is self-attention within the encoder, where keys, values, and queries all originate from the output of the previous encoder layer, enabling each position in the encoder to attend to all positions in the previous layer. The third application is self-attention within the decoder, allowing each position to attend to all preceding positions, including itself. To maintain the auto-regressive property and prevent leftward information flow, masking is applied within the scaled dot-product attention mechanism, setting illegal connections to negative infinity before the softmax function. Figure 2 illustrates this masking process. References [31, 2, 8] are cited as examples of sequence-to-sequence models using encoder-decoder attention.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n\"Description of Figure 2 is needed to provide a detailed description of the image content. Assuming Figure 2 illustrates the masking process in the decoder's self-attention mechanism, the description should include details about how the masking is visually represented (e.g., shaded areas, blocked connections), which connections are being masked, and how this relates to preventing leftward information flow and preserving the auto-regressive property. Without the image, a placeholder description is provided: Figure 2 likely depicts the masking mechanism used in the decoder self-attention.

        "original_text": "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [31, 2, 8].\n\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.\n\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.",

Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings and have the same dimension (dmodel) as the embeddings, allowing them to be summed. The document focuses on using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies for positional encoding, with the formulas PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel) and PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel), where pos is the position and i is the dimension. The wavelengths of these sinusoids form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. The rationale behind this choice is that it allows the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, as PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of PEpos for any fixed offset k. The document also mentions experimenting with learned positional embeddings, which yielded nearly identical results to the sinusoidal version. The sinusoidal version was chosen because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those encountered during training. The document also includes a table comparing the complexity, sequential operations, and maximum path length for different layer types: Self-Attention, Recurrent, Convolutional, and Restricted Self-Attention. The table shows how these metrics are affected by sequence length (n), representation dimension (d), kernel size (k), and neighborhood size (r).\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE***\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\nTable 1 presents a comparison of different layer types (Self-Attention, Recurrent, Convolutional, and Self-Attention (restricted)) based on their complexity per layer, sequential operations, and maximum path length. The table uses big O notation to represent the complexity. For Self-Attention, the complexity per layer is O(n^2 * d), sequential operations are O(1), and maximum path length is O(1). For Recurrent layers, the complexity per layer is O(n * d^2), sequential operations are O(n), and maximum path length is O(n). For Convolutional layers, the complexity per layer is O(k * n * d^2), sequential operations are O(1), and maximum path length is O(logk(n)). For Restricted Self-Attention, the complexity per layer is O(r * n * d), sequential operations are O(1), and maximum path length is O(n/r). Here, 'n' represents the sequence length, 'd' is the representation dimension, 'k' is the kernel size of convolutions, and 'r' is the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nPositional Encoding, Sequence Models, Transformer Networks, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, NLP, Sine

That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π.

Self-attention connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, while recurrent layers require O(n) sequential operations. Self-attention is faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length (n) is smaller than the representation dimensionality (d). For long sequences, self-attention can be restricted to a neighborhood of size r, increasing the maximum path length to O(n/r). Convolutional layers require O(n/k) layers for contiguous kernels or O(logk(n)) for dilated convolutions to connect all positions. Separable convolutions have a complexity of O(k · n · d + n · d2).

        "original_text": "4 Why Self-Attention\n\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu- tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,zn), with xi,zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.\n\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n\n6\n\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.",

Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.",

The models were trained on the WMT 2014 English-German dataset, which contains approximately 4.5 million sentence pairs. Byte-pair encoding was used to encode the sentences, resulting in a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French translation, the larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset was used, consisting of 36 million sentences. These sentences were split into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary. Sentence pairs were batched together based on approximate sequence length, with each training batch containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE***\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nTraining data, model training, WMT 2014, English-German dataset, English-French dataset, 4.5 million sentence pairs, 36 million sentences, byte-pair encoding, word-piece vocabulary, 37000 tokens, 32000 tokens, sentence batching, sequence length, source tokens, target tokens, training regime, machine translation, neural machine translation, NMT, batch size, vocabulary size, tokenization, WMT2014 English German, WMT2014 English French, approximate sequence length, training data size, English to German translation, English to French translation, batching strategy, token count, sentence pairs, training dataset, data preprocessing, model training details, training parameters, training configuration, section 5, section 5.1, training data and batching.",

For the base models, each training step took approximately 0.4 seconds, and the models were trained for 100,000 steps, which is equivalent to 12 hours. The big models had a step time of 1.0 seconds and were trained for 300,000 steps, totaling 3.5 days. The hyperparameters for the base models are described throughout the paper, while the details of the big models are found on the bottom line of table 3.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS

Residual dropout is applied to the output of each sub-layer and to the sums of embeddings and positional encodings, with a dropout rate of 0.1 for the base model. Label smoothing with a value of 0.1 is also employed, which hurts perplexity but improves accuracy and BLEU score. The document also presents a comparison of the Transformer model's performance against other state-of-the-art models on English-to-German (EN-DE) and English-to-French (EN-FR) translation tasks, measured by BLEU scores and training costs (FLOPs). The Transformer model achieves competitive BLEU scores with a fraction of the training cost compared to models like ByteNet, Deep-Att + PosUnk, GNMT + RL, ConvS2S, and MoE. The document includes a table summarizing the BLEU scores and training costs for various models, including both base models and ensemble methods. The Transformer (base model) achieves a BLEU score of 27.3 on EN-DE and 38.1 on EN-FR, with a training cost of 3.3 * 10^18 FLOPs. The Transformer (big) achieves a BLEU score of 28.4 on EN-DE and 41.0 on EN-FR, with a training cost of 2.3 * 10^19 FLOPs.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE***\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\nTable 1 and Table 2 present a comparative analysis of machine translation models, focusing on their performance in English-to-German (EN-DE) and English-to-French (EN-FR) translation tasks. The tables list various models, including ByteNet, Deep-Att + PosUnk, GNMT + RL, ConvS2S, MoE, Transformer (base model), and Transformer (big), along with their ensemble versions where applicable. The key metrics presented are BLEU scores for both EN-DE and EN-FR translation, and the training cost measured in FLOPs (floating-point operations). The tables highlight the Transformer model's efficiency, achieving competitive BLEU scores with significantly lower training costs compared to other models. Specific data points include: ByteNet (BLEU EN-DE: 23.75), Deep-Att + PosUnk (BLEU EN-FR: 39.2, Training Cost EN-FR: 1.0 * 10^20), GNMT + RL (BLEU EN-DE: 24.6, BLEU EN-FR: 39.92, Training Cost EN-DE: 2.3 * 10^19, Training Cost EN-FR: 1.4 * 10^20), ConvS2S (BLEU EN-DE: 25.16, BLEU EN-FR: 40.46, Training Cost EN-DE: 9.6 * 10^18, Training Cost EN-FR: 1.5 * 10^20), MoE (BLEU EN-DE: 26.03, BLEU EN-FR: 40.56, Training Cost EN-DE: 2.0 * 10^19, Training Cost EN-FR: 1.2 * 10^20), Transformer (base model) (BLEU EN-DE: 27.3, BLEU EN-FR: 38.1, Training Cost EN-DE: 3.3 * 10^18), and Transformer (big) (BLEU EN-DE: 28.4, BLEU EN-FR: 41.0, Training Cost EN-DE: 2.3 * 10^19). Ensemble models generally achieve higher BLEU scores but also incur higher training costs.\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nMachine Translation, Transformer Model, BLEU Score, Training Cost, FLOPs, English-to-German Translation, English-to-French Translation, EN-DE, EN-FR, newstest2014, Regularization, Residual Dropout, Dropout Rate, Label Smoothing, Perplexity, Accuracy, ByteNet, Deep-Att + PosUnk, GNMT + RL, ConvS2S, MoE, Ensemble Methods, Model Comparison, Neural Machine Translation, NMT, Pdrop, 0.1, epsilon, 0.1, Sub-layer, Embeddings, Positional Encodings, Encoder, Decoder, Stacks, State-of-the-art Models, Training Efficiency, Computational Cost, Floating Point Operations, BLEU EN-DE, BLEU EN-FR, Training Cost EN-DE, Training Cost EN-FR, Transformer (base model), Transformer (big), Deep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble, GNMT + RL Ensemble, ConvS2S Ensemble, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, AI, Natural Language Processing, NLP, Translation Performance, Model Training, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Optimization, Dropout Regularization, Label Smoothing Regularization, BLEU score comparison, training cost comparison, model performance comparison, translation accuracy, computational efficiency, regularization techniques in neural networks, transformer architecture, encoder-decoder models, attention mechanisms, machine translation benchmarks, newstest 2014 benchmark, model training cost in FLOPs, BLEU score for machine translation, dropout rate for regularization, label smoothing value, effect of regularization on perplexity, accuracy, and BLEU score, comparison of transformer model with other models, ensemble methods in machine translation, byteNet model performance, GNMT+RL model performance, ConvS2S model performance, MoE model performance, Deep-Att+PosUnk model performance, transformer base model performance, transformer big model performance, training cost of different machine translation models, BLEU score of different machine translation models, regularization techniques for transformer models, dropout and label smoothing in transformer models, machine translation evaluation metrics, machine translation training data, machine translation model architectures, deep learning for machine translation, neural networks for machine translation, attention mechanisms in machine translation, encoder-decoder architecture for machine translation, transformer model architecture, regularization methods in deep learning, dropout regularization, label smoothing regularization, machine translation performance evaluation, machine translation training process, machine translation model optimization, machine translation hyperparameter tuning, machine translation model comparison, machine translation benchmark datasets, newstest2014 dataset, BLEU score calculation, FLOPs calculation, training cost analysis, model performance analysis, regularization impact analysis, dropout impact analysis, label smoothing impact analysis, transformer model efficiency, machine translation model efficiency, computational cost of machine translation, accuracy of machine translation, perplexity of machine translation, machine translation model training, machine translation model evaluation, machine translation model optimization techniques, machine translation model hyperparameter tuning techniques, machine translation model comparison techniques, machine translation benchmark datasets, machine translation evaluation metrics, machine translation training data, machine translation model architectures, deep learning for machine translation, neural networks for machine translation, attention mechanisms in machine translation, encoder-decoder architecture for machine translation, transformer model architecture, regularization methods in deep learning, dropout regularization, label smoothing regularization, machine translation performance evaluation, machine translation training process, machine translation model optimization, machine translation hyperparameter tuning, machine translation model comparison, machine translation benchmark datasets, newstest2014 dataset, BLEU score calculation, FLOPs calculation, training cost analysis, model performance analysis, regularization impact analysis, dropout impact analysis, label smoothing impact analysis, transformer model efficiency, machine translation model efficiency, computational cost of machine translation, accuracy of machine translation, perplexity of machine translation.\n```",

The Transformer (big) model achieved a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4 on the English-to-German task, outperforming previous models by more than 2.0 BLEU. Training this model took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. The base model also surpassed previously published models at a lower training cost. On the English-to-French task, the Transformer (big) model achieved a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming previous single models with less than 1/4 of the training cost. The English-to-French model used a dropout rate of 0.1. The base models used an average of the last 5 checkpoints, while the big models used an average of the last 20 checkpoints. Beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 was used. The maximum output length during inference was set to input length + 50. The document also mentions a table (Table 2) summarizing the results and comparing translation quality and training costs to other model architectures. The number of floating-point operations is estimated by multiplying training time, number of GPUs, and the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU.\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE***\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\nThe document mentions \"Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature.\" and \"Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs.

        "original_text": "6 Results\n\n6.1 Machine Translation\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The conﬁguration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.\n\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\n\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\n\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU 5.",

The study explores variations in the number of attention heads, attention key size, model size, dropout rate, and positional encodings. The results are presented in Table 3, which includes metrics such as perplexity (per-wordpiece) and BLEU score. The base Transformer model achieves a BLEU score of 25.8 and a perplexity of 4.92. Single-head attention results in a 0.9 BLEU score decrease compared to the best setting. Reducing the attention key size (dk) negatively impacts model quality. Larger models and dropout are found to improve performance and prevent overfitting. Replacing sinusoidal positional encodings with learned positional embeddings yields nearly identical results. The big Transformer model achieves a BLEU score of 26.4 and a perplexity of 4.33. The document also mentions the TFLOPS values for different GPUs used in the experiments (K80, K40, M40, and P100).\n\nIMAGE_INTERPRETATION:\n***DO NOT USE THIS IMAGE***\n\nTABLE_INTERPRETATION:\nTable 3 presents variations on the Transformer architecture and their corresponding performance metrics on the English-to-German translation development set (newstest2013).

The table compares the base model with variations in the number of attention heads (A), attention key size (B), model size (C), dropout rate (D), and positional encoding (E). It also includes the \"big\" model configuration. The table shows the impact of these variations on perplexity and BLEU score. For example, varying the number of attention heads (1, 4, 16, 32) while keeping the amount of computation constant affects the BLEU score. Reducing the attention key size also impacts the BLEU score. Increasing the model size generally improves the BLEU score, and dropout is helpful in avoiding overfitting. Replacing sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings has little effect on the BLEU score.\n\nSEARCHABLE DESCRIPTION:\nTransformer model, architecture variations, English-to-German translation, newstest2013, development set, BLEU score, perplexity, attention heads, attention key size, model size, dropout, positional encoding, sinusoidal positional encoding, learned positional embeddings, d_model, d_ff, dk, dv, hyperparameters, beam search, overfitting, Table 3, neural machine translation, NMT, attention mechanism, encoder-decoder, TFLOPS, GPU, K80, K40, M40, P100, single-head attention, multi-head attention, feed-forward network, model dimension, training steps, parameter count, BLEU, PPL, machine translation, deep learning, artificial intelligence, AI, neural networks, language models, sequence-to-sequence, translation performance, model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, model optimization, model comparison, architecture search, performance metrics, natural language processing, NLP, attention mechanism variations, positional embeddings, dropout rate, model complexity, computational cost, model accuracy, translation quality, model training, model architecture, transformer layers, encoder layers, decoder layers, attention weights, attention scores, key size, value size, model depth, model width, model capacity, model parameters, model size, large models, small models, base model, big model, model configurations, experimental results, performance analysis, ablation study, component analysis, model design, model engineering, neural architecture search, NAS, hyperparameter optimization, model selection, model tuning, model development, model deployment, machine learning, deep neural networks, sequence modeling, text generation, language generation, text translation, machine translation evaluation, BLEU score improvement, perplexity reduction, model generalization, model robustness, model efficiency, computational efficiency, training time, inference time, model scalability, model interpretability, attention visualization, attention patterns, model behavior, model understanding, model debugging, model improvement, model refinement, model iteration, model experimentation, model validation, model testing, model benchmarking, model comparison, model selection criteria, performance trade-offs, model design choices, architectural decisions, hyperparameter settings, training data, validation data, test data, data preprocessing, data augmentation, model regularization, dropout regularization, weight decay, early stopping, gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, optimizer algorithms, Adam optimizer, SGD optimizer, model convergence, training loss, validation loss, test loss, model evaluation metrics, evaluation protocols, experimental setup, experimental design, research methodology, scientific investigation, empirical study, quantitative analysis, statistical analysis, data analysis, results interpretation, conclusion, findings, implications, future work, research directions, open questions, unsolved problems, challenges, opportunities, advancements, innovations, breakthroughs, state-of-the-art, cutting-edge technology, emerging trends, future prospects, potential applications, real-world impact, societal implications, ethical considerations, responsible AI, trustworthy AI, explainable AI, fair AI, unbiased AI, transparent AI, accountable AI, human-centered AI, AI for good, AI for social impact, AI for sustainable development, AI for global challenges, AI for humanity, AI for the future, artificial general intelligence, AGI, superintelligence, singularity, technological singularity, existential risk, AI safety, AI alignment, AI control, AI governance, AI ethics, AI policy, AI regulation, AI standards, AI certification, AI education, AI literacy, AI awareness, public understanding of AI, AI dialogue, AI collaboration, AI partnership, AI ecosystem, AI community, AI stakeholders, AI experts, AI researchers, AI engineers, AI practitioners, AI users, AI consumers, AI citizens, AI society, AI world, AI future, the future of AI, the impact of AI, the role of AI, the potential of AI, the challenges of AI, the risks of AI, the benefits of AI, the opportunities of AI, the responsibilities of AI, the ethics of AI, the governance of AI, the regulation of AI, the standards of AI, the certification of AI, the education of AI, the literacy of AI, the awareness of AI, the dialogue of AI, the collaboration of AI, the partnership of AI, the ecosystem of AI, the community of AI, the stakeholders of AI, the experts of AI, the researchers of AI, the engineers of AI, the practitioners of AI, the users of AI, the consumers of AI, the citizens of AI, the society of AI, the world of AI, the future of AI.",

We present these results in Table 3.\n\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\n\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\n\n8\n\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

        "original_text": "7 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.\n\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful comments, corrections and inspiration.\n\n9\n\n213",
