The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers.\n\nThe encoder has two sub-layers in each layer: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe decoder also has these two sub-layers, but inserts a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified with masking to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring that predictions for a position 'i' only depend on outputs at positions less than 'i'. This is combined with the output embeddings being offset by one position.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder employ residual connections around each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization. The output of each sub-layer is defined as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers and embedding layers in the model produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 1 shows a diagram of the Transformer model architecture, which is divided into two main parts: the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right.\n\nOn the left side, the process begins with \"Inputs\" which go into an \"Input Embedding\" layer. This is followed by \"Positional Encoding\". The result is then fed into a block labeled \"Nx\", indicating a stack of N layers. Each layer in this stack consists of a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer followed by an \"Add & Norm\" component, and then a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, also followed by an \"Add & Norm\" component. The output from this stack is then passed to the decoder section.\n\nOn the right side, the process starts with \"Outputs (shifted right)\" which go into an \"Output Embedding\" layer and then \"Positional Encoding\". This feeds into another \"Nx\" block. Each layer in the decoder stack has three main sub-layers. First, a \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\". Second, a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer that takes inputs from the encoder stack, also followed by \"Add & Norm\". Third, a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\".\n\nThe final output from the decoder stack goes through a \"Linear\" layer and then a \"Softmax\" layer to produce the \"Output Probabilities\". The diagram illustrates the use of residual connections, where the input to a sub-layer is added to its output before normalization (\"Add & Norm\").\n\nTABLE ANALYSIS: ***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***",

The inputs are queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. The process involves computing the dot product of a query with all keys, dividing each by the square root of dk, and then applying a softmax function to get the weights on the values. When computed on a set of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) simultaneously, the output matrix is calculated by the formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax( (Q*K^T) / sqrt(dk) ) * V. The two most common attention functions are additive attention and dot-product attention. Dot-product attention is identical to this algorithm but lacks the scaling factor. While similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is faster and more space-efficient because it uses highly optimized matrix multiplication. For larger values of dk, additive attention performs better than unscaled dot-product attention. This is because large dk values can lead to large dot products, pushing the softmax function into regions with very small gradients. To mitigate this, the dot products are scaled by 1/√dk.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 2 features two diagrams.

It details the process: a matrix multiplication of Q and K, followed by scaling, an optional mask, a SoftMax function, and another matrix multiplication with V to produce the output.

Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with dk a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√ . dk",
