The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of a stack of N=6 identical layers.\n\nThe encoder has two sub-layers in each layer: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe decoder also has these two sub-layers, but inserts a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified with masking to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring that predictions for a position 'i' only depend on outputs at positions less than 'i'. This is combined with the output embeddings being offset by one position.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder employ residual connections around each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization. The output of each sub-layer is defined as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers and embedding layers in the model produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 1 shows a diagram of the Transformer model architecture, which is divided into two main parts: the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right.\n\nOn the left side, the process begins with \"Inputs\" which go into an \"Input Embedding\" layer. This is followed by \"Positional Encoding\". The result is then fed into a block labeled \"Nx\", indicating a stack of N layers. Each layer in this stack consists of a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer followed by an \"Add & Norm\" component, and then a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, also followed by an \"Add & Norm\" component. The output from this stack is then passed to the decoder section.\n\nOn the right side, the process starts with \"Outputs (shifted right)\" which go into an \"Output Embedding\" layer and then \"Positional Encoding\". This feeds into another \"Nx\" block. Each layer in the decoder stack has three main sub-layers. First, a \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\". Second, a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer that takes inputs from the encoder stack, also followed by \"Add & Norm\". Third, a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\".\n\nThe final output from the decoder stack goes through a \"Linear\" layer and then a \"Softmax\" layer to produce the \"Output Probabilities\". The diagram illustrates the use of residual connections, where the input to a sub-layer is added to its output before normalization (\"Add & Norm\").\n\nTABLE ANALYSIS: ***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***",

The inputs for this function are queries (Q) and keys (K) of dimension dk, and values (V) of dimension dv. The process involves computing the dot products of the query with all keys, dividing each by the square root of dk, and then applying a softmax function to get the weights on the values. The entire operation is computed on matrices Q, K, and V, with the output matrix calculated by the formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKT / √dk)V. This method is a type of dot-product (multiplicative) attention, distinguished by the scaling factor of 1/√dk. Compared to additive attention, which uses a feed-forward network, dot-product attention is significantly faster and more space-efficient because it can be implemented with highly optimized matrix multiplication. For large values of dk, not scaling the dot products can lead to large magnitudes, pushing the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients.

The right diagram illustrates \"Multi-Head Attention\", which is depicted as several \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" layers operating in parallel.

We compute the matrix of outputs as:\n\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax( QKT √ dk )V (1)\n\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi- plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor 1√ of . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with dk a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3].
