The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.\n\nThe encoder's layers each have two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.\n\nThe decoder's layers have three sub-layers: a masked multi-head self-attention sub-layer, a multi-head attention sub-layer that attends over the encoder's output, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The self-attention sub-layer in the decoder is modified with masking to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions, ensuring predictions for position 'i' only depend on outputs at positions less than 'i'. This is combined with the output embeddings being offset by one position.\n\nBoth the encoder and decoder employ residual connections around each sub-layer, followed by layer normalization. The output of each sub-layer is defined as LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)). To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers and embedding layers in the model produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nThe model architecture starts with input and output embeddings, which are combined with positional encodings. The final output of the decoder stack is fed into a linear layer and a softmax layer to generate output probabilities.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 1 provides a detailed diagram of the Transformer model architecture, which is divided into two main components: the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right.\n\nThe encoder side shows the flow starting from \"Inputs\" which go into an \"Input Embedding\" layer, followed by the addition of \"Positional Encoding\". This combined embedding is then fed into a stack of N layers (indicated by \"Nx\"). Each layer in this stack consists of a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer followed by an \"Add & Norm\" step, and then a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, also followed by an \"Add & Norm\" step.\n\nThe decoder side starts with \"Outputs (shifted right)\" that go into an \"Output Embedding\" layer and also have \"Positional Encoding\" added. This is then fed into a similar stack of N layers. Each decoder layer has three sub-layers. The first is a \"Masked Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer, followed by \"Add & Norm\". The second is a \"Multi-Head Attention\" sub-layer that takes inputs from the encoder stack's output and the output of the previous decoder sub-layer, which is also followed by \"Add & Norm\". The third is a \"Feed Forward\" sub-layer, again followed by \"Add & Norm\".\n\nThe final output from the decoder stack is passed through a \"Linear\" layer and then a \"Softmax\" layer to produce the \"Output Probabilities\". The diagram clearly illustrates the residual connections around each sub-layer, which are then normalized (Add & Norm).\n\nTABLE ANALYSIS: ***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***",

To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.

The input for this attention mechanism consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. The process involves computing the dot products of the query with all keys, dividing each by the square root of dk, and then applying a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values. When computed on a set of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) simultaneously, the matrix of outputs is calculated by the formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax( QKT / √dk )V. The two most common attention functions are additive attention and dot-product attention. The described algorithm is identical to dot-product attention but includes a scaling factor of 1/√dk. Dot-product attention is noted to be much faster and more space-efficient in practice because it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. For large values of dk, additive attention can outperform dot-product attention without scaling. This is because large dot products can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients. To counteract this, the dot products are scaled by 1/√dk.\n\nIMAGE ANALYSIS: Figure 2 features two diagrams. The left diagram illustrates \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\". It shows inputs Q, K, and V. Q and K undergo a matrix multiplication (MatMul). The result is then scaled, optionally masked, and passed through a SoftMax function. The output of the SoftMax is then matrix multiplied with V to produce the final output. The right diagram illustrates \"Multi-Head Attention\". It shows V, K, and Q being fed into separate linear layers. The outputs are then processed by several parallel layers of \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\". The outputs of these parallel layers are concatenated and then passed through a final linear layer.\n\nTABLE ANALYSIS: ***DO NOT USE THIS TABLE***",

While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.\n\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3].
